4. Technical Architecture & Stack
Frontend Architecture
The portfolio will be built using a modern, scalable frontend architecture focused on performance, maintainability, and clean component design.
Core Technologies:
•	Next.js (App Router Architecture) – Enables hybrid rendering (SSR/SSG), optimized routing, and SEO performance.
•	TypeScript – Ensures type safety and long-term scalability.
•	Tailwind CSS – Structured, utility-first styling for consistent UI.
•	shadcn/ui – Accessible, reusable component system.
•	Framer Motion & GSAP – High-performance animation engine for advanced UI interactions.
The frontend will follow a modular component-based structure with strict separation of concerns and optimized asset loading.
________________________________________
Backend Architecture
The application will support a structured backend layer depending on requirements.
Backend Capability:
•	Node.js (Express) – REST API layer for dynamic features and integrations.
•	Java (Spring Boot) – Scalable enterprise-grade backend architecture when required.
•	Python (FastAPI / Django) – Lightweight or data-driven backend services.
•	Secure API routing with proper validation and middleware.
•	Authentication-ready structure (JWT/session-based).
•	Secure form handling and email services.
•	Environment-based configuration management.
This ensures the portfolio is not limited to static rendering and can evolve into a dynamic system if required.
________________________________________
Database & Data Layer
•	MongoDB / MySQL depending on backend implementation.
•	Firebase integration when required for real-time features.
•	Structured schema design and optimized query handling.
________________________________________
Infrastructure & Deployment
•	Production-grade cloud deployment with CI/CD integration.
•	Optimized build pipeline.
•	Secure environment variable management.
•	HTTPS, caching, and CDN-backed asset delivery.
•	Performance monitoring readiness.
